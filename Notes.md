# Comments from Poulsen
 - When giving students feedback, they have very little patience for reading. They will do minimal reading of feedback given. So the feedback you give should be short and to the point.
 - It looks like you are generating a bunch of explanation comments for parts of the code that the student may already understand. I think that these will just be an annoyance for them and get in the way.

## Questions
 - Clarify better the problem the tool solves:
    - Is  it that students need feedback on their code as they are writing it? Or that they need feedback on it when they are done writing it?
    - What type of feedback? Stylistic feedback? Correctness feedback?
    - What can they get from this feedback that they can't get just from running their code against test cases?
